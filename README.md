How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  Interpreting user needs requires help from the project manager. The project manager should meet with stakholders to determine what they want their end users to experience. Creating user stories gives the scrum team the description of what is needed. It defines what the end user wants to do and what goal they want to accopmlish with each element of the project.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  Agile processes I would like to encorporate into future development work would be the daily meetings. I think this is a great time to have open communication about progress of the project.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Being a good team member involves a lot of communication. Without communication there is no cohesive team. Everyone on the team should also be able to accept criticism and be able to pivot.
